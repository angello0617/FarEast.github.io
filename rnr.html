                <h4> Offensive Rules</h4>
                <p>Players are required to dribble the ball with one hand while keeping both feet in motion. Should a player touch the ball with both hands or stop dribbling, they must then only move one foot, known as the pivot foot. A player is limited to a single instance of dribbling. Once they cease dribbling, they cannot begin another dribble. If a player does resume dribbling, it results in a double-dribbling violation, leading to a turnover, and the opposing team gains possession. A player can only initiate another dribble once the basketball has been touched or controlled by another player from either team, typically following a shot or a pass <br><br>
                    The basketball must remain within the boundaries of the court. If the offensive team loses possession of the ball due to it going out of bounds, the opposing team gains control of the basketball. While dribbling in basketball, players must keep their hand on top of the ball. If they touch the bottom of the basketball while dribbling and continue to do so, it is considered "carrying the ball," resulting in a turnover where the player loses possession to the other team.Upon crossing half court, the offensive team is prohibited from returning to the backcourt, which is known as a backcourt violation. However, if the defensive team deflects the ball into the backcourt, the offensive team can legally regain possession without penalty. <br><br>
                <h4> Defensive Rules</h4> <br>
                The primary directive for the defensive player is to avoid committing fouls, which involve gaining an unfair advantage through physical contact. While some interpretation lies with the referee, the general principle dictates that the defensive player must refrain from touching the offensive player in a manner that hinders their ability to maintain possession of the ball or successfully execute a shot. <br> 
               
            <h4>Rules for Everyone</h4> <br>
            The foul rule, though primarily associated with defensive actions, applies uniformly to all players on the basketball court, including those on the offensive side.

In basketball, players are not allowed to kick the ball or use their fist to strike it.

An important rule known as goaltending prohibits any player from touching the basketball while it is on its way down towards the basket or when it is resting on the rim. However, it's worth noting that touching the ball on the rim might be permissible in specific games.

Regardless of the position they play, all players on the court are bound by the same set of rules. The different positions in basketball serve as a strategy for team play but do not have a direct influence on the game's official rules.

                <h3>Defensive foul</h3>
                <p><b>Blocking foul-</b> A blocking foul is whistled when a player obstructs the movement of another player by using their body. This is commonly seen when a defensive player attempts to take a charge but fails to establish a stable position with their feet or initiates the contact themselves. <br><br>
                    <b>Hand check foul-</b>  A hand check foul is enforced when a player utilizes their hands to obstruct or slow down the movement of another player. Typically, this foul is called against the defensive player who is guarding the ball-handler on the perimeter. <br><br>
                   <b> Holding foul- </b> Similar to a hand check foul, this violation is typically called when a player grabs and clings onto another player to impede their movement deliberately. <br><br>
                  <b> Illegal Hand Use - </b>This foul is called whenever a player makes illegal use of their hands on another player. It's commonly enforced when a player hits their opponent's arm during a shooting attempt or while trying to steal the ball. <br><br>
                  <h3>Offensive foul</h3>
                  <b>Charging-</b>Charging is called against the player with the ball when they collide with another player who has already established their position. If the defensive player lacks proper position or is in motion, the official typically rules a blocking foul against the defender. <br><br>
                 <b>Moving screen -</b>A moving screen foul is called when the player who sets a pick or screen is in motion. To properly set a screen, a player must maintain a stationary position without shifting to obstruct their opponent. If a player slides even slightly to impede the defender, it results in a moving screen foul being called by the referees.
